Goa is one of the most happening places in India. It is known for its beautiful beaches, western culture and nightlife.

But there's one question, is Goa still that happening what it used to be earlier?  Some will say yes and others will say no. Yes seems fine but why a no to the most happening place of India.

What led to this negative opinion is a concern now. The first thing that changed the whole perspective is the crowd in Goan beaches. I have been hearing from a lot of people around that now all the famous beaches are not safe at all to spend a whole night chilling there. Beaches and the fun of sitting at shacks are also now losing its charm as it is too much crowded.

But no one can deny the fact that Goa is one the most happening places in India. So to avoid such bad experiences, plan your trip accordingly.

Here are the options that you can explore when you place your Goa trip:
### Visit hidden beaches of Goa.
Calangute Beach and Baga beach are the two of the most famous beaches in North Goa. It is suggested to avoid North Goa and you can visit South Goa. You can enjoy Patnem Beach in South Goa. Beaches in South Goa are very quiet and beautiful that gives you the much-needed peace of mind.
It is located at the extreme south of the Goa and as usual, you can rent a bike or car to reach there. Patnem Beach is full of white sands and crystal clear waters that almost seems untouched. It is one of the most peaceful places to swim, surf and soak up the sun. Nightlife is very minimal around the beach but you can enjoy live music at beach shacks.

### Other beaches that you can explore:
Kakolem Beach
Palolem Beach
AromBOL Beach
Agonda Beach
Sinquerim Beach

### Luxury Resorts/Hotels: 
If you planning your trip anytime soon then be careful. It's very hot in the summers. Goa is also well known for luxury resorts and hotels located on the beach. Few of the most exciting and famous properties having access to the private beach are listed below:
### The LaLiT Golf and Spa Resort, Goa: 
One of the best resort located in  South Goa. If you have a healthy budget then definitely you should experience the property. Also, you will get access to its private beach.
### Taj Fort Aguada Resort and Spa, Goa: 
If you are planning to stick to North Goa and then Taj seems the best option. It is located at Candolim beach. Taj is the first luxury hotel in Goa.
### ITC Grand Goa Resort and Spa: 
It is also located in South Goa. The ITC Grand Goa, with direct access to the pristine Arossim beach, provides all the ingredients for an invigorating or intimate relaxed getaway. The village-style resort's architecture draws inspiration from the Indo-Portuguese vintage and blends classical elegance with a distinctive regional allure that's infused in its service, cuisine and rituals.
### Goa Marriott Resort and Spa: 
Marriott is located in the northern part of the Goa. You can access North Goa's exhilarating gaming and entertainment destination from this resort.

You can also try Marbela Beach Resort, Seashell Suites and Villas.

Water Sports in Goa are worth experiencing specially Banana ride at Baga beach. Also, Parasailing is something that one should experience.
